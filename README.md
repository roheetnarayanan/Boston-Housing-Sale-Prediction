**Project Description:**

In this project we will be predicting the Housing price in Boston using python and Scikit-learn. The prediction is performed using the Linear Regression model.It contains 506  Houses with 13 Features.

       - TAX     -- full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
       - PTRATIO -- pupil-teacher ratio by
